        About me
      </h2>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6 pt-2">
        Hello! I&apos;m a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for leveraging
        technology to solve real-world problems. With a knack for building
        dynamic and interactive web applications, I&apos;ve honed my skills
        across a wide range of technologies that enable me to transform ideas
        into reality.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        My technical arsenal is diverse, covering both frontend and backend
        development. I am proficient in <strong>Next.js</strong>, a{" "}
        <strong>React</strong> framework that provides me with capabilities to
        build performant, SEO-friendly, production-grade{" "}
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> applications with ease. Alongside, I am an
        avid fan of <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, a utility-first CSS framework
        that gives me full control over my designs. This ensures that every
        application I build is not just highly functional, but aesthetically
        pleasing as well.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        My skills go beyond the visual surface and into the architecture that
        makes web applications robust and efficient. With{" "}
        <strong>Vercel</strong>, I deploy and host applications ensuring optimal
        performance and user experience. The <strong>Serverless</strong>{" "}
        architecture means I can move at speed, and with great flexibility when
        it comes to <strong>CI/CD</strong>. I use <strong>Shadcn UI</strong>, an
        innovative UI library, to add an engaging visual interface to the
        applications I develop. I am well versed in <strong>Clerk</strong>, a
        complete authentication and user management solution, which helps me
        provide top-notch authentication to the products I develop.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        I am also well-versed in handling databases, being proficient in{" "}
        <strong>Prisma</strong>, a next-generation ORM for{" "}
        <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>. With{" "}
        <strong>MySQL</strong>/<strong>PlanetScale</strong> as my database
        technology of choice, I design data models that are efficient, secure,
        and scalable.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        My technical expertise, coupled with a problem-solving mindset and a
        keen eye for detail, enables me to create web applications that are not
        just functional, but also user-friendly and visually appealing. I always
        stay updated with the latest technologies and trends, ensuring that
        every product I build meets the expectations of the modern user.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        But that&apos;s not all about me! I believe in sharing knowledge and
        actively contribute to various online communities, helping budding
        developers find their footing in this vast tech landscape. I am also an
        advocate for clean and sustainable coding practices, making sure that
        every line of code I write is efficient and maintainable.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        In conclusion, I&apos;m not just a Full Stack Engineer, but a dedicated
        technophile committed to using my knowledge and skills to create
        applications that make a difference. Whether it&apos;s a complex
        enterprise solution or a unique start-up idea, I&apos;m always ready to
